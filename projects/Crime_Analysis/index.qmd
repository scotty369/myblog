# **Crime Statstics Analysis**

## *Crime Count by Location*

Crime is overwhelmingly concentrated in residences and public streets, with significantly lower rates in other locations. This highlights the need for targeted policing and crime prevention efforts in these high-risk areas. Understanding the underlying factors driving crime in homes and streets is crucial for effective intervention.

## *Offender Race Distribution*

The data shows a disproportionate number of offenders identified as Black or African American and White, raising questions about socio-economic influences and systemic factors. A large number of "Not Specified" and "Unknown" entries also point to gaps in data collection, emphasizing the need for improved reporting practices to support more accurate analysis and intervention.

## *Victim Race Distribution*

White individuals are the most frequently reported victims, followed by Black or African American individuals, though with a substantial gap between the two. The presence of "Unknown" and "Not Specified" categories signals incomplete data, limiting a full understanding of victimization trends. More precise data collection is essential for targeted crime prevention and community support.

## *Crime Trends Over Time*

Property crimes, particularly vandalism, dominate this crime landscape, forming a "long tail" distribution where a few offenses are highly prevalent while others occur infrequently. While addressing property damage is a priority, law enforcement must also be prepared to tackle a diverse range of lesser-reported crimes. Understanding the factors driving both common and rare offenses is key to effective crime prevention in the city.
