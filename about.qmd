Hi there! My name is Scott Townsend, and I’m a Data Scientist with a strong background in data science and machine learning. I've worked on various projects ranging from statistical analyses to building machine learning models, and I’m passionate about using data to drive actionable insights.

Through this blog, I’ll be sharing updates on my ongoing projects, insights, and challenges I encounter along the way. I’ll also showcase data science projects I’ve completed, highlighting the tools, techniques, and results from each.
